gridlock

gridlock in a fast car
a sober drunk
only a week into

a window broken
is just pain
no view

and I 
am like all this

desires
urges
hopes

tear up and down
left
right

at least 
I have some center

even though
it feels 
like a cell 

many days 

some day

I hope us all
have better

open paths
roads
views 

movement
