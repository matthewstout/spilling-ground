You’d think
Pain

Would teach me
io stop
or be stronger

Not be
this orbit
On the drain

Not this comfort
in knowing
I have always enough
step in me to jump aside

To know
so clearly
that the sky of desire
grew a little too clear

And with it
I a little too willing
To just be whatever

And not a thorn
In this latest pain
I’d have always been
before

No smiles
just grey skies
is

now a good day

Sun some sort
of celebration come to me
not a plan I save
for it

You'd think
Pain

even if it is the goal
was achievable
was a place to go
and leave

but no
its my place
that feels right

a place
where lose is rare

achievement not expected

luck really luck
and useless standards have trash can large enough

It is here
I feel I have three walls
and so much less to watch out for
even if I will never smile

This is why
I am here
and not walking on shinier ice
with the most of you

I need this
rock

this
what will be

no matter
what
