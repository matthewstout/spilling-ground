There are oaks
that hold hands
and form heads
That cut the sun into small drops
like air to rain

When a trunk falls
Itâ€™s a burn
Bright bright burn
In the heart of the dappled paradise below

Wish for cover
not windows
here

Deserts can keep
their heat
Their brighter light
they can stand for

Here we need
all holding
hands arms roots
mass dispersion
Life

Little drops
big
