I know

That fog
Makes you cold

And that you’re 
Not alone

But for me
It’s a blanket 

And that is
A happy but quiet
Thing

Like how
When we sleep
Together 
It’s also alone
Happy
 under each our own
Blanket 

So if
Tonight

In this fog

I drift
Quiet
It is happily 

Sorry
If this was ever
Or always 
A different moment 
For you

It’s 
Not you
