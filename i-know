I know

That fog
Makes you cold

And that you’re 
Not alone

But for me
It’s a blanket 

And that is
A happy but quiet thing

Like how
When we sleep together
It’s also alone

Happy
Under each our own blanket

So if
Tonight

In this fog

I drift
Quiet
It is happily 

Sorry
If this was ever
Or always 
A different moment 
For you

It’s 
Not you
