Concrete’s
A lonely thing
But can be filled

Accepts paint
The native gray
Cares not to love
Or hate any color you can come in with
on your mind

It’s cold
But really only dense

And treats heat that way
absorbs
Yours
But also the ground
Or long averages
Of air

It’s easier
Like too much in life
To take such heavy things
Where and as they are

Not to seek change
In all the ways you want
Head on

But to add doors
In walls
And bring in the world
Or take yourself
Your best out to it

Go under
Or over
Until you find that sun
Then you’ll
Be beyond
Such anchors

And until then
Paint it well
