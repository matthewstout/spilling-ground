Concrete is
a lonely thing
but can be filled

Accepts paint
The native gray
cares not to love
or hate any color you can come in with

It’s cold
But really only dense

And treats heat that way
absorbs yours
But also the ground
Or long averages
of air

Really its less cold
and lonely
than slow

It’s easier
like too much in life
to take such heavy things
where and as they are

Not to seek change
in all the ways you want
head on

Yet it will sap
your life just laying still

Add doors
lessen whole walls
And bring in the world
Or take yourself
your best out

Go under
or over
until you find that sun

Then you’ll
be beyond
such anchors

And until then
paint it well
and do something
we haven't seen
