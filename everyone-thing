Everyone
Can always
get what they want

It’s just
sometimes 
It’s the bottom 
of a bottle 

An end
Of a relationship 
That only wants 
a fight

Or it is
Noon sunshine 
cause you’re cold
When you know
should want the picture perfect sunset
Paired with that romance you’ll never have again

Or coffee with a foam heart
From a van with none of the tech
To make that tick

All glory
Is surface

Living deeper
longer

The ocean and air
think

We live on one side
And see on just the surface

Decide what pain
To make part of the story 
And what to just never even share

Its all a story
And surface
To others

Despite
My decades 
Of wanting to be seen

I got 
What I wanted
Or tried hard enough to surface
