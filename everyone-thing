Everyone
Can get what they want
Always

It’s just
sometimes it’s the bottom
of a bottle

An end
Of a relationship
That only wants
a fight

Or it is
Noon sunshine
cause you’re cold
When you know
you should want the picture perfect sunset
Paired with that romance you’ll never have again

Or coffee with a foam heart
From a van with none of the tech
To make that tick

All glory
Is surface

Living
is deeper

longer
too dull in the infrequent glances

Like the ocean and air
thick with
barrier thin

We live on one side
but share just the surface

Decide what pain
To make part of the story
And what to just never even share

Its all a story
And surface
To others

Despite
My decades
Of wanting to be seen

I got
What I wanted
Or tried hard enough to surface
