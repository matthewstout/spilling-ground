I pay my registration late
And it seems to work out fine
The smog’s the same fee it was
Four months ago
And I get
All this time
And time
Is precious

So for double a couple fees
I get time
Time old time
It rains less now
And my T-shirt feels
And fits right
Now

It’s a good day
For drive
Sticker-ed and all

One less reason
For someone
To tell me
To get it
Together

But fools
All of them
I cheated time
And this time won
