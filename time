Time

I pay my registration late
And it seems to work out fine
The smog’s the same fee it was
four months ago
And I get
All this time
And time
is precious

There's a couple double fees
but hardly what time is worth
I get time
Time old time

It rains less now
and my T-shirt feels
more right

Funny how April does that
to November

It’s a good day
For drive
Sticker-ed and all

One less reason
For someone
To tell me
To get it
Together

But fools
all of them
I cheated time
and this time, won
