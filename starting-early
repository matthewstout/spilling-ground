I was born drunk
House full of liquor
And now I wish to be captive
In a prison
that has only milk snd honey
a paradise that doesn’t sting
At 20 pounds
The sips from the glasses for two
Fills you well
But now
I want
A paradise
That Doesn’t distill intent
sharp like broken glass
That doesn’t hang over backwards
to remind you
Of all the over done
I do
One that doesn’t
Spill guts
And yet leave blood
To bleed when cut
