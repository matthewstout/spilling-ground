I was born drunk
House full of liquor
and people better on it

And now I wish to be captive
In a prison
that has only milk snd honey
a paradise that doesn’t sting

At 20 pounds
The sips from the glasses for two
Fills you well
But now
I want
A paradise
That Doesn’t distill intent
sharp, like broken glass

That doesn’t hang over backwards
to remind you
Of all the over done
I do

One that doesn’t
spill guts
And yet leave blood
to bleed when cut
My problem
is always being
enough

A cloak, thin, but there
of I can hold his
we'd know if there was a problem
Even flirts with exceptional

Oh how it covers
for all my real ills
and all the more
I could be
