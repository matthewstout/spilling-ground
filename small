mostly useless
stuck circling
My bones’ gravity
Until one more right
Is wronged

Surprised
All my cracks
Can pass as wrinkles

Can serve
As wisdom

But then by Tuesday
I’m just crying inside

And would crawl
Except for age
and what it does to knees

My problems
Are small

But my problems
Are real
And like everyone
We meet
what we have
with What we have

So today
I won’t hate
Another
For falling down

I’ll only ask
That we get up
And walk on
Until our pillows
Keep us for good

And my bones
Are light as air
And not scaffolding
Beneath my parts that touch
