Memories of a dark cloud

This dirt
used to sprout seeds

And we used to
not argue like this

Trees still flourished in spring
till summer tortured them to fall

My wisps of hope
I put them out on the only lines I know
But nothing bites

Small clouds
still take a few turns
fighting or dancing

But like our silence
There’s more dirt
Than seeds or green
Or growth

And I can’t tell
if your happy
