Don’t
fail your fire

But worse
pretend you have one
if you don’t

Someone has to fill the freeways
even me
when I’m feeling
like playing bills
and other grown games

Or the pickle
old as old
Life is no longer
About you

But all
the depends
On
that, like you
or not,
count on your small add of gravity
in the complex set of orbits
we evolved into

fire
passion
all trick-ier
the more years
you add
and the more
you have
to win or lose
