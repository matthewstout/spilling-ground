Friday
has the worst weather of the week

We’re all letting loose
not planning for clouds over kisses
but there’ll be plenty

We’ll notice
a sunset
if it stains enough of the sky
but pretty much do what we already doing

We’ll take the rain
Or wind as long as it’s it’s usual
Just annoying

We’ll touch
Who we touch
But rarely reach for the sky

It is the day we use the world
its winds and whims
to blame or confirm
all sorts of deeds
and outcomes

just too much
onour minds
to just sit
and take in the wwather
