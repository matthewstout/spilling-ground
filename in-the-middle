In the middle 


Of October 
I’m a loss of summer 


I don’t feel like it’s all okay
Carving gourds 
Even though I like it 

And them
Lit with candles 

It’s loss
If not all just a holding 

Surviving 
Will we eat 
till the sun takes us back
Of course always
Nowadays 

So what now
Is there to really struggle through

And shouldn’t we have 
Been less then

Why this long tradition 
To lie to ourselves 

It’s hard

And far easier now
March
Me to April

I’ll just be here
Until
We’re ready

Loving it all anew 
Due to this pause

That’s 
The only diamond 
In it
