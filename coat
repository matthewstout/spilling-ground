You wear
me out
into this winter of life

Because I’m the coat
you know

Not because
I’m good or bad

Not because I’m pretty
or sad

And maybe
This is good

No one can really be
if they're too into someone else

But I can’t shake
the cracks

The loose rocks
we call foundation

At best
we’re moving though this space
with the agility of poor swimmers

Floating on dead leaves
Not standing tall
making paths

I hope one day
you’ll smile
just because it’s me

And not
bury me this summer
in that dark closet

Behind extras
and old board games
that we once smiled over
