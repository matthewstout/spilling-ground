I don’t
Know

If I’m mad
At you

Or me

But
I’m mad

And all
I see

Right
Now

Is focused
By this fever

I only hope
Somehow

We see
Each
Other

Through
To a more mysterious
And happier
World

Where sunsets say more
Than my current
Ill state

To a day
Where we’re not
Counting minutes
Till morning
But wishing the clock to slow
