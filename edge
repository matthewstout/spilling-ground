Between
the dirt on the outside
and the fog on the in
my window on the world
is impaired

And it’s not only
the colors I chose
or the drinks I swallowed

There’s noise
Even my door only quiets

And every
Little thing
I tune out
Adds up

I've heard it called
taking the edge off

and it lets me walk
then sleep
and fill the in between

but the why
and for what
is more lost than ever
