When
we care
for bars

more than schools
or parks

or smiles

or any
other happy

We should
preference irrelevant
Understand
the world we walk

The force
we stand
it up with
and the cost
real

All the tools
to shut it up
liquids and tablets
lights and phones

disposable care
But still wake up

Sad

Too tired

The power
Of leaving

Can kill or birth

Itâ€™s calm to
Live
A life without love
But only that

Somedays
No longer
Hope for more
And worse
Do so dry eyed

I wish
All far more
Well
