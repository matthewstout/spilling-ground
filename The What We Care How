When
we care
for bars

more than schools
or parks

or smiles

or any
other happy

We should
preference irrelevant

Understand
the world we walk

The force
we stand it up
with
and the cost
real

All the tools
to shut it up
And not care

But still wake up
Sad
Too tired

The power
Of leaving

Can kill or birth

It’s calm to
Live
A life without love
But only that

Booze
Makes still
So digestible
But only cause it is so

On a level
Somewhere
In all our own

We care
For things
We can call better

And stand cover
Over
What we are
And get both sides
Wrong

I
Somedays
No longer
Hope for more
And worse
Do so dry eyed

I wish
All far more
Well

1997
Had all the promise
Of my youth
70s formed
80s Polish
Still high on moon walks
And computers

Framed
In anything
But the coming failure

To be
But what we are

Always were
The who we
Are

Not endless
Inventions
Only the surface knows us
Know

And being
Tied to a history roped to text
Is so peculiar

I thought
we just had to be

And that
That alone was light enough
To fly above
All the souls that tried
So much as hard

The failed comfort,
That just a different heart,
Is all we needed

That selfishness and interest
Don’t but replicate bad solutions
Like the sun sets and rises

We can change the air
But wind still demands
We wake again and raise
The right flag all over again

I’m gonna
Rest a little more
Tonight
But with a new
New chip
Chip on my comfort
And do
All over
Again
