Hanging On

One hand
Hanging out with a foot

Driving  the car

The other hanging on 
to reality 

And maybe
Staying ready to open a door

Or maybe it was
a dream or two

Some glimmer of what’s not
As possibility that makes the now warmer 

Its not much
But there’s a wheel
Some peddles to make things go
And a door for when its time to stop

Remember my smile
That’s all I’m after 
And all in between
