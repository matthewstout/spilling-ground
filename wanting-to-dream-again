I don’t
Know

If I’m mad
At you

Or me

But
I’m mad

And all
I see

Right
Now

Is focused
By this fever

I only hope
Somehow

We see
each
other

through
to a more mysterious
and happier
world

Where sunsets say more
than my current
ill state

where maybe
I can see them
again

To a day
where we’re not
counting minutes
till morning

But wishing
the clock to slow
and other whims
